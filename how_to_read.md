## Introduction

One of the most valuable skills I learnt isn't specific to cryptography but is simply how to read a research paper.
Once you can do this your ability to teach yourself massively improves and you can keep up with the latest advances in whatever your sub-field is.
(There is a reason I list [IACR's ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) on my [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page.)
There have been many times at work when teams have come to me and said "What does this mean?" and handed me a dense paper to work through.
Being able to make sense of them has been a god-send.

Unfortunately reading a research paper can be very hard and is a different set of skills from reading most other things.
(For example, you don't start at the beginning and read to the end.)
This means that lots of people (like me) will try to read some and then quickly give up when it just doesn't make sense.
This page aims to save people the frustration that I've had to deal with.

The guidance here is split into two sections.
The first should apply to (almost) all research papers, regardless of field.
The second is specific to cryptography.

## Reading a research paper

Before you read a research paper you need to know what _your_ goal is for reading it.
* Are you trying to learn more about the general field?
* Are you trying to figure out if the paper matters to you?
* Are you trying to learn the specific results from the paper?
* Are you trying to understand and evaluate the work that lead to the result?
* ...

Each goal requires a different focus and approach.
The strategies laid out below work reasonably well for each, but you'll need to customize them depending on your specific needs.
What do you take notes on? What do you skip?

### Generic strategies

A research paper generally consists of the following sections in order:
1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Summary
4. (Optional) Background
5. Actual body of the paper
6. Conclusion
7. References/Citations

For those of us used to reading "normal" things we instinctually want to try this in order.
That doesn't work well.
Instead, it's best to generally read them in this order.

1. Title (You have to know what you're reading)
2. Abstract (Gives you the shape of the paper and lets you know if it's worth your time)
3. Summary (Like the abstract but meatier)
4. **At this point you can sometimes stop because you may have learnt everything really necessary depending on the situation.**
5. Background (Optional. If you already know the subject-matter, you can skip it. Otherwise this may be the most valuable part of the paper.)
6. Skim the References (Optional. This is a great way to learn the field and figure out what you might want to read next, or even first before you re-approach this paper.)
7. Conclusions (What was the result?)
8. **This is the second good stopping point.**
9. Skim the Body *skip proofs, any graphs or data-sets which seem too dense, etc.* (You're looking to understand the overall argument of the paper and are just trusting that the authors can support their arguments, so you don't need to check their work.)
10. **This is usually where I stop.**
11. Re-read the body, including all detailed proofs and data with an eye to understand exactly what they did, how, and catch errors if there are any.

As you go, make notes.
* If you have questions about what's going on, write them down so you don't forget them.
* Any interesting citations should be saved for later reading.
* If you can summarize a key part in your own words, do so. It will help you remember and understand it.

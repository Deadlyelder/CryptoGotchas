## Introduction

One of the most valuable skills I learnt isn't specific to cryptography but is simply how to read a research paper.
Once you can do this your ability to teach yourself massively improves and you can keep up with the latest advances in whatever your sub-field is.
(There is a reason I list [IACR's ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/) on my [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page.)
There have been many times at work when teams have come to me and said "What does this mean?" and handed me a dense paper to work through.
Being able to make sense of them has been a god-send.

Unfortunately reading a research paper can be very hard and is a different set of skills from reading most other things.
(For example, you don't start at the beginning and read to the end.)
This means that lots of people (like me) will try to read some and then quickly give up when it just doesn't make sense.
This page aims to save people the frustration that I've had to deal with.

The guidance here is split into two sections.
The first should apply to (almost) all research papers, regardless of field.
The second is specific to cryptography.

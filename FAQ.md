## What is this?
I have been involved with literally hundreds of cryptographic designs, reviews, and implementations and have been extremely fortunate that the vast majority of people I've worked with are really smart and good at what they do.

This also means that they have a tendency to ask lots of good questions.

Some of these questions are, well, frequent.
So, unlike most FAQs on the internet which now are pre-emptive guesses of what people want to know, this list actually consists of frequently asked questions.
Unlike the main [gotchas](./README.md) list, most (all?) of these aren't mistakes are sharp edges.
Instead, these are intended to satisfy the curiousity of people who look at a cryptographic design and ask "Why is it this way?" or "I understand the main principal, but why did I ge this *specific* guidance?

Like everything else here, these answers (and questions) are very much my personal opinions or (at best) general industry consensus/best-practices filtered through me

## Questions (to be organized?)

### What is "Security Strength" or "Bits of Security"?

### What do you mean when you talk about matching security levels across a system? (And why don't things always match up?)

### Why do you always tell me to rotate keys before I reach one billion encryptions?

### What is the actual impact of quantum computers on cryptography?

### Why is scheme FOO designed one way but scheme BAR designed entirely differently?

### Why ~you~ cryptographers so pedantic?

### What does it take to safely work with cryptography?

### Why does everyone tell me not to "roll my own cryptography" or to just not do it?

### Is algorithm FOO backdoored or compromized?

# Contributions and Licensing

I'm always interested in receiving feedback. [Issues](https://github.com/SalusaSecondus/CryptoGotchas/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/SalusaSecondus/CryptoGotchas/pulls) are probably best, but any (reasonable) way to reach out will work.

Is there a mistake? Tell me!

Am I missing something important? Please let me know!

Can you help flesh out my references or otherwise improve this? I want to hear from you!

Several people have already shared pre-publication papers or other non-public materials with me to help me in drafting accurate and helpful _public_ documentation. If you have something you want to share in confidence with me but don't want me to share it on, please reach out to me so we can chat.

The license I've attached to this document is somewhat of a placeholder and exists solely to have something well defined attached. If it causes problems for you for _any reason at all_ please let me know and I'll work with you to come to some mutually agreeable solution
